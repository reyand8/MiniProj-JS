## ðŸ“œ Main Information 

This project was made to practise my skills, and it consists of four mini applications.
1. **Home page** is with basic information and without any functionality.
2. **Counter** is used to increase and decrease numbers.
3. **Quiz** consists of five questions. The first three questions provide answer 
options, the fourth question provides an input where you have to enter the answer.
In the fifth question, it is necessary to choose true or false. At the end, you 
receive your result.
4. **Users** application allows you to select people and send them invitations. 
The list of data was generated on mockapi.io . REST API is used to GET, EDIT and DELETE data. 
Besides this, you can use a search input to find a specific person.
5. **Gallery** allows you to see a board with different photo collections. The data was generated 
on mockapi.io. The collections are divided into different categories. There is an input for 
searching for a specific collection.
